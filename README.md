## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (version 1.x)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for running the app locally)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for running the app on a physical device or simulator)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gymscript.git
   cd gymscript
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Use Yarn to install the project‚Äôs dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**
   After installing dependencies, you need to set up Prisma and migrate the database schema. Run the following commands:
    Generate the Prisma Client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```
   Run the database migrations:
   ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
This ensures your database is set up correctly and that Prisma can generate the required client for database interaction.

### Running the App

Once everything is set up, you can run the app using yarn.

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   This will open up the Expo Developer Tools, allowing you to run the app on a simulator, physical device, or web browser.
